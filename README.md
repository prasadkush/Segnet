## Instructions for training:

run python main.py

## Results on Kitti test dataset 
The model in modelv2.py was trained on kitti semantic segmentation dataset obtained from [kitti website] (https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_semseg.php?benchmark=semantics2015), consisting of 200 training images
